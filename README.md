# scissors-paper-rock

One of my first programs written in Javascript.

Most outputs are in the console
5 rounds overall
User inputs either scissors, paper or rock. The selection is case insensitive (can be upper or lower case, or a mix of both)
Clicking 'Cancel' or pressing ESC at any time will stop the script and print Game Cancelled in the console
Entering anything other than scissors, paper or rock or entering no value will result in an error. This makes that round void, but you can keep playing
The computer's choice is randomly generated and evaluated against the user input
The console will print whether you won, lost or drew. It will print what both choices were
It will print which round you are up to, as well as the current score
After 5 rounds, the console will print who was the overall winner
