# scissors-paper-rock

One of my first programs written in Javascript.

- Most outputs are in the console<br>
- 5 rounds overall<br>
- User inputs either scissors, paper or rock. The selection is case insensitive (can be upper or lower case, or a mix of both)<br>
- Clicking 'Cancel' or pressing ESC at any time will stop the script and print Game Cancelled in the console<br>
- Entering anything other than scissors, paper or rock or entering no value will result in an error. This makes that round void, but you can keep playing<br>
- The computer's choice is randomly generated and evaluated against the user input<br>
- The console will print whether you won, lost or drew. It will print what both choices were<br>
- It will print which round you are up to, as well as the current score<br>
- After 5 rounds, the console will print who was the overall winner<br>
- Refresh the page to start a new game
