# scissors-paper-rock

One of my first programs written in Javascript.

v1
- Most outputs are in the console<br>
- 5 rounds overall<br>
- User inputs either scissors, paper or rock. The selection is case insensitive (can be upper or lower case, or a mix of both)<br>
- Clicking 'Cancel' or pressing ESC at any time will stop the script and print Game Cancelled in the console<br>
- Entering anything other than scissors, paper or rock or entering no value will result in an error. This makes that round void, but you can keep playing<br>
- The computer's choice is randomly generated and evaluated against the user input<br>
- The console will print whether you won, lost or drew. It will print what both choices were<br>
- It will print which round you are up to, as well as the current score<br>
- After 5 rounds, the console will print who was the overall winner<br>
- Refresh the page to start a new game<br>

v2
- Fresh UI added, no more using the console or text input from the user<br>
- First to 5 wins<br>
- Player selects an input, the computer is automatically chosen at random<br>
- Displays the winner of the current round<br>
- Displays how many wins the player and computer each have<br>
- Once someone reaches 5, a winner is declared and the counters return to zero<br>
- The game can be reset at any time using the Reset button<br>
